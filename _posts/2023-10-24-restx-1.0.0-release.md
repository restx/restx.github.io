Today we are very happy to announce release 1.0.0 of RESTX (after a long period of inactivity), this release support now Java 17.

## News

- Migration from Java 8 to Java 17.
- Cookies are now encoded in Base58 format, as Tomcat and Jetty no longer accept special characters in cookies.
- Jetty embed updated from 8 to 11 and Tomcat embed from 7 to 10.
- Updated Jongo to version 1.5.1 and the Mongo driver to version 4.8.2 (Mongo 6.0 support).
- Servlet-api updated from 2.5 to 5.0.0.
- Many dependencies updated (Jackson, Snakeyaml, Guava, etc.).
- Annotation processor updated (Java 17 compatibility).
- Kotlin support

## Getting started / Upgrading

Want to get started now? Check out the [related doc](/docs/getting-started.html).

Upgrading from an earlier version?

- You need to update `restx.version` to `1.0.0`.
- Your project should now use Java 17 to work with this version and futures releases
- Dependency module `restx-server-jetty7` is removed

### Module merged

Some module has Java 8 compatibility, but with latest release has only Java 17 support and more, these modules was useless and merged.

- if you're using module `restx-core-java8`, you just need to import `restx-core`.
- if you're using module `restx-jongo-java8`, you just need to import `restx-jongo`.
- if you're using module `restx-samplest-java8`, you just need to import `restx-samplest`.
- if you're using module `restx-specs-tests-java8`, you just need to import `restx-jongo`.

### Module disabled

We don't consider these modules to be mandatory at first, and updating them is rather complex, so we've decided to temporarily disable them.

- restx-apidocs-doclet
- restx-api-doclet-test
- restx-jongo-specs-tests
