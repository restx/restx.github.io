  (2) run 'shell upgrade' command inside restx shell

If you want to reinstall it from scratch:
  (1) run 'rm `which restx`'
  (2) relaunch this script

Couldn't write the launcher script. Please either:

  (1) Add ~/.restx to your path, or
  (2) Rerun this command to try again.

Then to get started, see the docs at

Now you need to do one of the following:

  (1) Add ~/.restx to your path, or
  (2) Run this command as root:
        ln -s ~/.restx/restx /usr/bin/restx

Then to get started, see the docs at
